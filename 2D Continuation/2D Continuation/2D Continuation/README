These Matlab files solve the initial value problem, the boundary value problem, and the boundary value continuation problem for the following system:
x1' = sin(x3)   x2' = cos(x3)   x3' = p3
p1' = 0   p2' = 0   p3' = p1*sin(x3) - p2*cos(x3)


Run the file main_IVP_solver.m to solve the initial value problem.
Run the file main_BVP_solver.m to solve the boundary value problem.
Run the file main_continuation_solver.m to solve the boundary value continuation problem.
